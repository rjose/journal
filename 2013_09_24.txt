Alright, so what do I want to do today? I want to clean up the snapshot
service and have it be easily configurable (i.e., easy to map resource headers
to files). I also want to set up a 0mq-based system that can automatically
update conditioned data and real data whenever the raw data changes. Need to
do error handling here as well. I should also figure out how to use the SHA
with the snapshot service. This should be communicated to the browser somehow
and used in "what if" scenarios. I bet I can do the stuff above pretty
quickly. Let's quickly sketch out more stuff.

Once the structure is set up, I should be able to pull data for other
applications (like the rampline app). That might be an interesting exercise. I
also want to think about how to integrate snapshots and "what ifs" into all
apps in a generic fashion.

Main items:

        - [X] Clean up snapshot service
        - Hook up 0mq-based qplan system
                - [X] Needs to handle errors
                - Needs to be easily started and stopped from a single script
        - Use snapshot SHA in web app

More items:

        - Prototype rampline app and pull data from qplan snapshot service
        - Sketch out thoughts on integrating snapshots and "what ifs" into all
          apps
        - I should really clean up the sectionize.py file to make it more like
          the lua version
        - I should get the 0mq lua bindings to work

OK, I got the data flow to work through 0mq. Tomorrow, I really need to clean
up the python scripts that do this. After that, I'll hook up the web server
(via lua). Oh, and I also want to read config info from file (but I'll see
that as I'm cleaning up). OK, got lua-zmq installed and was able to retrieve
the qplan app data from the snapshot service. I think we're ready to integrate
this into the web app.
