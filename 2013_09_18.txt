Next Steps
----------
There's a couple of ways I can go. I can keep going along the multi-team
planning route. I can start implementing the mobile public ramp timeline. I'll
probably need to work with Sara on this. I could also focus on the things that
were giving me the most grief around data quality (columns moving, fields with
invalid data, etc.). There's also trying to hook into JIRA to get more tracking
data.

Probably the very next step is to get more robust in our data handling. This is
the thing with the most pain right now. After that, I can start thinking about
the rampline app. Is that a good name for it? I guess I can run with this for
now.

What about making it easy to start and run one of these servers? We may need to
bundle code up.

Rampline
--------
I should create a separate repo for this, I think. This should drive the sharing
of code between qplan. We need to estimate dev complete dates for each item and
then group into product, theme, and month. Somewhere, we should have a ramp plan
for each feature. We need to draw from this. I think this is the first time I'll
need to create IDs for work items. Maybe this can be in JIRA? I'll have to ask
Sara or Linzhen.
