Conditioning Scripts
====================

Here are some of the main problems I've run into:

        * Column added or removed
        * Invalid data in cell

Here are some things I want to add/extract:

        * Override start and end dates from the commandline
        * [X] Pack an estimate string
        * [X] Condition string values
        * [X] Condition triage
        * [X] Date parsing/formatting
        * [X] Vacation handling (supply hook for conditioning vacation data)
        * [X] Condition cell values
        * [X] Check for all streams up front
        * [X] Handle column movement
        

I also want to structure the conditioning scripts a bit better so I can easily
re-use the functions from one version of a spreadsheet to another.

Most of the code in the script should be custom code that understands the
quirks of the input data.

Implementation
--------------
Alright, so what's the best way to do this? Let's add section checks first and
then pull the printing code out into functions and then call them. When this
works, let's start pulling common functions out into modules. After that,
let's add column checks.

Alright, let's create a conditioning module and add pack string...Done! Next,
let's condition string values.

OK, last topic here is handling column movement. How will we do this? We need
to specify the *exact* column header to look for. We need to generate a
mapping of column header to column index. Done!
