Alright, so what are my options for today? I'm thinking:

        * Update gcat to pull all columns
        * Sketch out some charts for planning (these should be good demos)
        * Add ids to columns in text list
        * Add documentation to shell scripts

Let's start with the charts. These are the most visual and appealing demos. Once
this is out of the way, we can go deeper. I'll sketch out some thoughts on my
iPad and go from there.

Sketching out charts
--------------------
So what questions do people want answered? The goal of all of this is to aid in
decision-making. We want to give a visual indication of where things stand. We
want to be able to zoom in to understand a specific area. Here are some
ideas/thoughts:

        * How much work is scheduled? What does demand look like by different
          groupings (e.g., track, product manager, team)? How far are we short?
          What's fully resourced, and what's not.
                ** I'm thinking of the "shortage charts" here with an option to
                   click to show the details of the chart

        * What are the big priority 1s? What is their impact relative to other
          number 1s?
                ** I'm thinking of a 4 quadrant chart here.

        * Show chart of resource availability.

        * What are the cross-team dependencies? Are there any priority
          conflicts? Can we generate a rough timeline based on overall team
          members (this wouldn't have specific assignments yet).

Alright, should I do the easy ones first, or the hard ones? Well, I want to at
least look at the directed graphs. Let's try this first.

Implementation
--------------
Alright, here's my plan for the rest of today:

. Create simple dag chart [X][][][][]
. Create angular directive for d3 element [][][][][][]
. Create the quadrant chart [][][][]


1 - Create simple dag chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I'll start by looking for a quick demo. I'll just go with the "force layout"
example in the "Interactive Data Visualization" book. First, I'll wire things up
so I can trigger the draw...Done! Next, I'll follow along. OK, I was able to get
this to work, but I'm wondering if we just need to lay out nodes similar to the
quadrant chart, adding colors as needed. Let's come back to this after we have
more experience with the other charts.


2 - Create angular directive for d3 element
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The reason I'm doing this is to get back into having angular be what's
coordinating the page flow. I think we should be able to create things like
"demo_quadrant" and have it just work. I'll have to review the angular docs
again first. I'll create a chart module. OK, I set up a directive called
"quadrantdemo" that will construct a quadrant chart. This is how I'll figure out
what data I'll need for this. Let's follow along with a demo to get things set
up. Alright, I got a simple plot to render. Let's check this in. OK, now let's
add a scale next. After that, we can add the quadrants. For the quadrants, we
just need to draw some lines. Done. Next, let's add some meta information that
can be shown on click. We should have angular render this. Done.

I think we want an umbrella LiveContentCtrl that can activate the appropriate
view for the given message. It should use a websocket service to handle
messages. We should just create an svg element explicitly as well as a pre
element for raw output. The controller should ideally set the view type (raw,
quadrant, etc.) and data. 


For tomorrow
------------
Here's some stuff to think about for tomorrow.

. Add axis labels and title to quad chart
. Render metadata from quad chart
. Create resource availability chart [][][]
. Create spreadsheets with data

Some thoughts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What if we let people manipulate the live feed and have it be broadcast to
everyone else?

We might want the server to store the current live feed data so new clients can
see it, too. That's an enhancement for later.

I want to revise how charts.js works so that we can swap out the various chart
types on demand.
