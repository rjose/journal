I want to get to a point where we can hook mqplan data up to our server, but I
think I want to rework qplan and mqplan to use the same server. We just need a
way to configure the server to point to a lua root and to listen on a specific
port. I would rather have one server per app instance even though technically,
we could run several apps on one.

If we can get to this point, I can extract the server code out into its own
repo and simplify both the qplan and mqplan repos. I wonder if we should
rename this to be a cat server. Maybe I'll call it catserve or csrv? I think I
like catserve the best. Let's create a new repo for this and start moving the
qplan server stuff over to it.
