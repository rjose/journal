============
Rino Jose <@rjose>

Today, we'll do some porting and cleanup. I want to get the scripts ready to
do Q4 planning. I should check on the wiki that people put together for Q3 (I
think this had themes, etc on it). We should add those items to the
spreadsheet.

I also want to take a crack at adding IDs to all items. This will be important
for the multi-team planning. Thinking about multi-team planning, what we want
to show is how effort is aligned along the key metrics and OKRs. Not sure how
to represent the OKRs yet. We'll need a different kind of websocket channel
for the multi-team app. I'd like to get something running this week.


Worklist
--------
- [X] Port QPlan to desktop
- [X] Revise gcat to pull all columns [X]
- [X] Generate list of items missing from Q3 [][][]

1 - Port QPlan to desktop
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Just installed Python 3 and we're done.


2 - Revise gcat to pull all columns
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alright, let's start by reverting gcat to a state where I can pull all columns
in one shot. Once this is in place, I'll grab the status spreadsheet that Sara
is maintaining. Done! Let's check this in.


3 - Generate list of items missing from Q3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alright, what do we want to do here? Let's grab the original Q3 data and the
status data. I'll add IDs for each line so we can group these. What goes into
the report? We want to organize these by track. We want to show items that
were originally planned and items we expect to be done. We should have a
separate report of the items that won't make it into Q3. We want our track
leads to figure out which of these should go into Q4.

What are some things I need to do? I need to decode the track names. I need to
note items that are new with respect to the plan. I want to store track,
merged priority, name from the original spreadsheet. That sounds like one awk
filter. I want to store track, name, status from the second spreadsheet.

So what should these reports look like? Here's what's in and out.

-----
        == Track: Contacts
        -- Expected
        #125 1 Task name
        **  ** Added task name

        -- At risk

        -- Planned but missed
        #101 1.5 Task that won't make it
-----

Here are candidates for Q4

-----
        == Track: Contacts
        #117 1 Task name
        **  ** Added task name
-----

How can we implement the first report? The first spreadsheet should give us
something like a database. The second should give us in and out. We interpret
de-scoped as out. Blocked means "at risk".

OK, I'll put the first report into a function and then set up the second
report which generates the backlog. I need to pull from the Q3 plan and the
items that won't make it from the status spreadsheet. So what do we want? We
want all items from status that are out. We also want all items from Q3 that
are not done.

Let's check in what we have and then add some arg parsing. Tomorrow, we should
clean up the functions.



4 - Create multi-team planning app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What questions are we trying to answer? How about:

        - What are other teams working on?
                - Zoom in
        - Is my dependency in the plan?
                - Is it a priority?
                - When will it be done?
        - How are teams lined up on key initiatives?
        - Where are the resource risks?
        - Where are the schedule risks?
        - Where are the priority inversions?



For Tomorrow
------------
- Create multi-team planning app [][][][][][]
- Document shell scripts
- Add scripts that can stack and unstack streams
- Debug status script
- Clean up status script
- Sketch out talks
