STrack

Alright, I was able to pull JIRA data! I'll have to figure out the sprints and
the boards, but I should be able to get some structured data to tie into
tracking. What information would be good to show?

        - Estimated completion dates for each task
        - Thread this up to completion dates for project line items
        - Would be nice to show what's a planning estimate and what's from
          JIRA
        - Can also combine JIRA data with vacation data
        - Can show what's slipping
        - Can show who's doing what
        - Can show activity chart (who's doing what when)
        - Can show what's done and what's left
        - Can show deltas from week-to-week and from current to quarter plan
        - Can show activity by theme (like a heat map)

What's the flow look like? Maybe like this:

        . cat board and sprint keys into jiracat to get incomplete/complete
          tasks for each active sprint
        . Combine this with data from the quarter plan and vacations

TODO: Think about git and data persistence
