Today, I want to get mqplan to a state where I can demo it. That means we need
to get data into it and display some auxiliary info. Let's do a really simple
layout for now and focus on getting the data hooked up.

Worklist
--------

- [X] Push mqplan work to github dev branch
- Add layout algorithm for selected chart
- Add hash frag to page for selected chart
- Add ajax call to server for selected chart
- Update mqplan with data
- Push mqplan work back to github
- Get Q4 items collected and a first cut at value


For Tomorrow
------------
- Attend Felix standup at 11:15 and take notes
- Write script that can do diff on status spreadsheet
- Write script that adds ids to work items
- Document shell scripts
- Add scripts that can stack and unstack streams
- Debug status script
- Clean up status script
- Compute an optimism coeff for Q3
