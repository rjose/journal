Snapshot Service
================
Rino Jose <@rjose>

Let's create a snapshot service repo for the general snapshot code. Actual
snapshot services will use the code from here but in their own git repos.

We'll start by writing a python script that uses the 0mq bindings. I want to
stub out responses to figure out what a protocol might look like.

Alright, I installed zmq for python2.6. The simple server/client demo work.

Implementation
--------------
. [X] cat raw data into a snapshot message [X][X][][]
. [X] Get raw data at HEAD and SHA [X][X][][]
. [X] Publish PUT events
. [X] Clean up functions [X][X][X][X][]


1 - cat raw data into a snapshot message
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's create a snapshot service that lives on 5000. Messages are stacked
streams. Actually, let's create a client first that constructs a stacked
stream from cat'd data. Done.

Now, let's write this data into a file from the server and commit it to the
repo. Done!


2 - Get raw data at HEAD (and SHA)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Alright, now let's see if we can get data from the HEAD. There must be a way
to ask git for the version of a file at the head of the master branch. OK,
this is how you do it:

        - git show HEAD:raw/qplan.txt

To get a particular version, use this:

        - git show 0eb4a:raw/qplan.txt

Alright, this is pretty neat. To get the actual data, what should we do? We
can send a message like this:

        . =====GET raw qplan

This will return the data at the HEAD. If we wanted to get a particuar
version, we could do this:

        . =====GET raw qplan
        . \t0eab4a

Let's start by just returning the HEAD and then add requesting the version.
Alright, I can get the HEAD data. Let's wrap this in a stream. Done!

I also got this running with an arbitrary version. We should handle the case
where the SHA doesn't exist.
        

.Thoughts
Should we hide filepaths from the clients or not? Let's hide them, but have
the code be ready to switch.


3 - Publish PUT events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To do this properly, I need to understand the PUB/SUB pattern in 0mq. Let's
see if I can make sense of this. When the conditioning service starts up, it
should try to pull data right away and condition it. If there's no data there,
it should subscribe to the raw qplan data broadcast of the snapshot service.
Alright, it looks like there's a topic filter that we can use. Let's have the
publisher service running on port 5100. The topics will be "qplan raw",
"qplan conditioned", and "qplan results".

What should be in the message? Maybe nothing. It may be enough for the
listeners to pull the HEAD data when they see this. Let's hook something up.
Done! Pretty awesome! Tomorrow, we'll need to clean this file up.

4 - Clean up functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let's rename server.py to snapshot.py and check in. After that, we'll pull
functions up into the top part of the file. If it makes sense to pull these
functions out into separate files, we'll do that too. OK, I have an event loop
that's printing when we get a PUT event. Let's hook up the committing of this
file next. I'll assume that the repo has already been initialized.

OK, I'm able to put a resource generically to git. Next up is getting the data
generically. Done! Let's check this in and then see if we should make this
into an object. OK, this is now a class. Let's check this in and then pull the
custom parts out. Done!

I was about to add commandline args, but maybe I'll wait until I need this.
Let's wrap this up by adding some documentation. Done!


TODO: We should have a script that starts everything up
TODO: Clean up implementation of sectionize.py (make it more like the lua
version)

More thoughts
-------------
The snapshot service should just handle snapshots. It shouldn't process data
at all. The flow for raw data to results should be:

        . Someone makes a PUT request to the snapshot service with raw data
        . The snapshot service checks it in and then publishes this event
        . Subscribers react to this event. One of them is the conditioning
          script.
        . When the conditioning script is done, it makes a PUT request to the
          snapshot service.
        . The snapshot service checks this in and then publishes the event.
        . The application filter reacts to the event by pulling the
          conditioned data and generating results, which it PUTs to the
          snapshot server.

The snapshot service needs to be fairly simple and generic. It should do the
following:

        - Handle PUT requests, hiding file path from clients
        - Publish PUT events
        - Handle GET requests

As we customize a snapshot service for other cases, the main thing will be to
define the type of data being stored and where it goes. We should structure
the snapshot service this way right now.
