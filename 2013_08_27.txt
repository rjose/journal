============
Rino Jose <@rjose>

Today, we'll do some porting and cleanup. I want to get the scripts ready to
do Q4 planning. I should check on the wiki that people put together for Q3 (I
think this had themes, etc on it). We should add those items to the
spreadsheet.

I also want to take a crack at adding IDs to all items. This will be important
for the multi-team planning. Thinking about multi-team planning, what we want
to show is how effort is aligned along the key metrics and OKRs. Not sure how
to represent the OKRs yet. We'll need a different kind of websocket channel
for the multi-team app. I'd like to get something running this week.


Worklist
--------
- [X] Start creating multi-team planning app
- [X] Attend Austin standup at 10am and take notes
- [X] Attend Scrooge standup at 10:45 and take notes
- [X] Touch base with Tomer on metrics eval spreadsheet



1 - Create multi-team planning app
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What questions are we trying to answer? How about:

        - What are other teams working on?
                - Zoom in
        - Is my dependency in the plan?
                - Is it a priority?
                - When will it be done?
        - How are teams lined up on key initiatives?
        - Where are the resource risks?
        - Where are the schedule risks?
        - Where are the priority inversions?

I think this is one level up from each team's quarterly planning (though, it's
really part of it). I want to show shortage charts for each team. I want some
way to show dependencies between teams. I want some way to show disagreements
in priority. I want some way to show when things should be done. We may be
able to do a rough estimate of this based on the rankings. Let me sketch out a
thought. OK, I think I have an idea of what I want to build. It seems like I
should be able to put a lightweight spec together for this now.

.Transition on click
Here's what I'm thinking about when transitioning on click. We should go from
an array of shortage charts to a view that shows dependencies between what we
clicked on and the other shortage charts. An HTML view should also come into
the picture showing a list of things that are in and out as well as the
dependencies. Prereqs that are unfunded in other teams should be highlighted
in red. Unfunded work items that other teams need should also be highlighted
in red.

.Getting started
Let's get started by creating a new mqplan repo. We'll need to include qplan
as a subtree to re-use parts from it. I'll start a new lightweight spec to
capture the ideas I've listed out here.

For Tomorrow
------------
- Attend Felix standup at 11:15 and take notes
- Write script that can do diff on status spreadsheet
- Write script that adds ids to work items
- Document shell scripts
- Add scripts that can stack and unstack streams
- Debug status script
- Clean up status script
- Compute an optimism coeff for Q3
