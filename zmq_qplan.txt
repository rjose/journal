ZeroMQ QPlan System
===================
Rino Jose <@rjose>

I want to set up a system that automatically pulls data, snapshots it, and
transforms it. The Web server should pull from the snapshot service directly
via 0mq.

What's the first step? Let's create our q4 repo. This will hold both our
scripts and the snapshots. We'll set up the snapshot service first and then
get some raw data in. Let's write a script that pulls spreadsheet data
(eventually it will do this regularly). Alright, I have a script that pulls
raw data and snapshots it.

Let's add a script that listens for changes and conditions the data. I think
this script should also listen for its own conditioned data being published to
get raw data as well. Actually, we'd need two different threads for this. I
guess it could work, but let's just have another process for this.

OK, I can pull raw data, publish it and then have it be automatically
conditioned. Let's add a little bit of exception handling to the
condition_raw_data call so we don't try to commit the file if something went
wrong. Done.

Alright, the next step is hooking up the qplan filter itself. We'll have
python do this via popen. We should use pull_raw as an example here. Alright,
got the processing to work. Let's stick this into a loop and then trigger
everything with a pull raw.
