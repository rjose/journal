We should rename the old endpoint and then commandeer it. First goal is just
receiving the data. After that, we'll need to parse the JSON and set up the data
within lua.

I did a little sneak peek at this and loaded the q3.json file in a lua shell.
Was able to decode the json and access the info from lua. I think this should ge
pretty smoothly.

We'll just cat q3.json over. Done.

OK, let's get the staffing stats rendered first. We'll do it in terms of
manpower and then convert to people. We'll need the number of weeks. We'll also
need to handle zero weeks left. Done!

NOTE: I had to do this to deal with a quote char:

        cat q3.json| sed s/\'//g | curl -X POST -d @- http://localhost:8888/qplan

Not sure if this is a curl thing.
