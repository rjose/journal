Q4 Scrub

- Is merged triage used being used yet? If not, we should clear the column.
  This should be what we ultimately use to indicate what's in and out.
- Mobilize needs estimates (Ganesh)
- Work should be sorted in priority order in spreadsheet (by triage first)

- Felix needs work items (take from Conan? Merge with other track?)
- Relationships needs staff
- SRE needs a track

- Merged Rapportive into Intros


- Money needs estimates
- Remove empty tablet task

Planning Sequence
-----------------
. Ensure work is estimated
. Ensure work is sorted in priority order
. Look at triage 1 for each track. What fits, what doesn't.
. Redefine tracks and recondition data
. Look at where things land
. Group by theme. Add buffer for ramp plan.
