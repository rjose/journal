Rino Jose <@rjose>

Let's start today with some simple renaming. I want to abbreviate as much as
possible. We'll start with the broadcast functions and go from there.

Worklist
--------
- [X] Rename broadcast functions [X][X]
- [X] Write pipeline for storage charts [X][X][X][X]


1 - Rename broadcast functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
What I want to do here is replace all of the broadcast functions with a single
function called bcast that can take different options. To do this, we'll need to
add a python module for the broadcast types. Let's start with piechart since we
have data we can cat to it. Done. As we do the shortage chart, I'd like to do
some TDD on this.

First, let's try to do some commandline arg parsing in python. Looks like
there's an
link:http://docs.python.org/2/library/argparse.html#module-argparse[argparse
module] that may do what I want. Let's start with this. Done.

While we're at this, let's collapse all of the broadcast functions in the same
way. We'll do raw next. Done!

2 - Write pipeline for storage charts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The first step is moving the storage chart into a python module. After that,
I'll set up a unit test for it. Hmmm. I think the format text functions should
be renamed to be parse text and they should return python dictionaries. The
bcast file should convert the python dictionary into JSON. Alright, let's
rewrite bcast to take a python dictionary. Done!

Alright, I got the rest of the charts moved over to being cat-able. Let's merge
this back down and push it to origin.


For Monday
----------
- Revise gcat to pull all columns [][][]
- Add spreadsheets with data
- Document shell scripts
- Render auxiliary data from shortage chart
- Note issues regarding communication of status [][]
